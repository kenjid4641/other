git clone URL - Copies the ssh and puts it next to the git clone. Clones the repository

git status - See what files have been edited since the last commit

git add file - Adds the files to the staging area to be controlled

git add . - Add all files in the current repo to the staging area and for it to be committed

git commit -m "message" - Commits the edits you made locally

git push - Change commit from local to remote

git diff - Shows you what changed

git log - Shows committed shapshots

q (while in git diff/log) - quit

git pull - Changes commit from remote to local

git restore file - reverts a commit with a staged file

git revert SHA - reverts but with a hash

git revert HEAD - reverts the last commit
```

## Challenges
i had a pretty big challenge with getting distracted while having the commands explained, which would lead to errors like using ```git commit``` and wondering why the gnu was popping up, and wondering what was happening
```
User: git commit

(imagine the gnu popping up)
```

## Takeaways
the github command line is essential for using github effectively, and i had to catch up on a lot of things becaues i didnt know what was happening. thankfully i caught up for the most part and i can now use the terminal like everyone else
