## Concept: 
The Command Line (also known as cli)

## dictonary:

```
mkdir: makes directory

rmdir: removes directory

rm: removes something

pwd: shows you your directory

rm -rf: removes with force

touch: makes a file

cd: redirects to directory

â†‘ up arrow): fills out the command you previously done

tab key: shows all commands (sometimes you type help)

clear: clears everything

control c: copy

control d: kills a process

control x:

..: parent directory

~: takes you to root (or home)

/: seperates a directory (for example: .root/folder/textfile.txt)

mv: renames a directory or file or moves it depending on how you use it

to move: mv file.txt root/folder

to rename: mv file.txt file1.txt

echo: prints out what you do (i use it for fun and for testing)
sudo: not in the version of the command line used on hstat sep site, but it bascially means administrator permission
```
## Challanges
I didn't really have any challanges with the command line that I can think of, but the main problem I have is forgetting commands. for example it took me 20 minutes to realise that `~` meant go to `/root` and not `sudo` for some reason
```
~ mkdir e
/root: Permission denied

```


## takeaways
The command line is an excellent way of doing things reliably and quickly, for example instead of going to open a folder to create a text file, you can just go `touch root/folder/subfolder txtfile.txt`

`Also when in doubt, type sudo rm -rf *` :)
